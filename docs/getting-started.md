# Getting started

_Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ (PSA)  is a Blender addon for advanced environmental lighting that provides high quality atmospherics
and lighting, and visual consistency between every object in your scene. It can be installed as any other Blender addon.
## Requirements

Latest _Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ is supported by [Blender 3.4+](https://www.blender.org/).
Addon versions from v1.2 till 1.6.1 works on [Blender 2.81 - 3.3](https://www.blender.org/).

## Installation

!!! info
    "Physical Starlight and Atmopshere" is only available for purchase on
    [Blendermarket](https://blendermarket.com/products/physical-starlight-and-atmosphere) or [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/PSaA).
    Get your latest version there.

- Download the "physical-starlight-atmosphere-[version here].zip" file.
- Open Blender.
- Go to Edit/Preferences. 
- Choose "Add-ons" tab and press "Install..." button. 
- Locate the .zip file and press "Install Add-on".
- You will see the newly installed add-on, enable it by checking the checkbox. 
- Wait till it registers. Voila!

## First Run
- Locate _Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ panel in [Sidebar](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/regions.html#sidebar)
also called _N Panel_ (You can also find addon panel in the World Properties). Click on the tab _Atmosphere_ to reveal it.
- Enable addon by ticking the uppermost checkbox.

 
!!! important
    To see the sky, you have to be in "Rendered" Viewport Shading mode (click on the 4th sphere in the list up in the right corner of 3D viewport)

!!! summary "What happens when addon is being enabled/disabled?"
    - A couple of shader nodes are imported and dynamically added and connected to the currently active world. When you uncheck the _Physical Atmosphere_ checkbox, these nodes will be removed.
    - Sun lamp `Sarlight Sun` is added. The Sun lamp is used as the main light source to cast shadows from the Sun. When you uncheck the _Physical Atmosphere_ checkbox, if no active PSA instances are found in other worlds it will be removed.

!!! important
    If PSA 1.7 is not enabling for you or the Blender system console is outputing an error, that looks something like this:
        [![Error](img/UI/error_output.png)](img/UI/error_output.png)
    
    Please make sure to disable other addons that you have installed and enabled in your current Blender instance, before enabling PSA 1.7+ for the first time. This will mitigate any interference from other addons, and will configure the PSA preset files correctly. This will need to be performed only once - the first time you enable PSA.

    After PSA has been enabled as detailed above, you can enable the other addons you wish to use. 


## Preferences
There is no _The One_ way to use this addon. That is why we encourage you to find the way
it works best for you. Addon [preferences panel](img/UI/UI_preferences.png) is located under
`Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.

### Toolbar Enabled
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `true`

By default, the _Atmosphere_ tab is in the sidebar of Blender 3D viewport (`N` key) and "World Properties" tab in
Properties panel. Setting this to `false` will hide the toolbar. Reveal panel by clicking on _Atmosphere_ tab. 

### Toolbar Label
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `"Atmosphere"`

By default, Toolbar tab for _Physical Starlight and Atmosphere_ is _Atmosphere_. It might be useful to rename it
to something shorter like `PSA` to reduce space the tab is taking. 

### Use ACES color space
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

The Academy Color Encoding System[^1] (ACES) is a color image encoding system created by hundreds of industry professionals. ACES allows for a fully encompassing color accurate workflow, with seamless interchange of high quality motion picture images regardless of source.


### Use real world physical values
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

By default, addon reduces `atmosphere`, `sun` and `stars` intensity values to get the feeling _it just works_, and you 
don't have to modify extra parameter `Exposure` in order to get realistic atmosphere. But very important part of this 
addon is having real world physical values to support visual consistency.

<!-- ### Experimental Features
:octicons-milestone-24: _Default_: `false`

Enables features that may not be fully functional and tested for all cases. Current list of experimental features:

* [Binary Sun](/psa/binary-sun/) -->

## Presets

Presets allow you to store a snapshot of your customized atmosphere settings and return to it later or use already predefined presets provided by the addon.
the addon comes with 10 different presets:

- earth
- earth 2
- earth 3
- hazy summer
- mars
- nishita
- retrowave
- tatooine
- thick fog
- thick haze
  
### Using presets

1. Install the PSA addon (version 1.8+)
2. Enable the addon inside the *Blender Preferences*
3. Enable the addon inside the *Blender Viewport*, which will make the presets visible inside Blender
4. In the n panel under ''presets'' pick a preset of your liking
5. You should now see the preset in your scene!

??? summary "Troubleshooting: Concerning previous versions of Presets"     
    If you have used the previous versions of Presets (using the asset browser) this is how you can migrate them to the new system:
                
      - Navigate to Blender asset libraries
      - There you have to find the User Library ''PSA'' or the library's name that corresponds to your presets
      - drag the asset in to your scene
      - create a new preset through the n panel, name and save it
      - you now have your preset migrated!
        

### How to make your own presets

1. In the PSA panel click ''+ new preset''
2. Name it
3. Modify the PSA parameters to your liking
4. Save the changes you made!

!!! tip 

     Use ''Use preset sun location'' if you want to save the suns location in the preset. If you dont want the preset to change your suns location then leave the box unchecked
