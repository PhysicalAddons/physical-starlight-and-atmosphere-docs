### How to add Fog to the materials?

Physical Starlight and Atmopshere not only influences the "sky" but also materials.

***NOTE: since version v1.2 fog addition is automated by a toggle button in UI***

Here is how to add fog to materials:

- When Physical Starlight and Atmopshere addon is enabled, navigate to "Ground" tab.

- "Atmosphere Density", "Distance Scalar" and "Falloff" has the most apparent impact on the fog.
