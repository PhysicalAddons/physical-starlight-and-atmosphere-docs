note:  fireflies are abnormally bright pixels relative to their surroundings.
Unfortunately using Cycles in combination with scenes that have low light levels will cause fireflies. Currently, try widely known solutions mentioned in this [StackExchange post](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/1703/how-to-reduce-fireflies-in-cycles).
