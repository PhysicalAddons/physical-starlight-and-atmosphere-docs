Motivation \u00b6 Outdoor lighting in is essential in computer graphics and Blender still has no proper skylight system available. Preetham and Hosek-Wilkie sky included in Blender is very rudimentary and practically unusable. Even skylight systems in other software suites are very limited. A common practice in almost all of CG software is that components like sky, sun, fog, water, clouds, lighting is considered separate entities and they do not interact to each other. In real, physical world everything influences everything. Even bigger issue can happen when different components are created by separate teams. It causes issues where one component looks amazing and realistic, but then everything else looks off and disconnected. Then artist's responsibility is to find the issues, tweak the settings, add fake lights and other \"magic\" to connect the pieces back to a nice overall render. At least this has been my workflow for many years and it just felt wrong. so... I developed my own rendering system in GLSL for BGE (Blender Game Engine) with which I made most of my projects. It was made with PBR (Physically Based Rendering) in mind. System was time consuming to adapt to other projects so I started to play around with shader node editor. To my surprise, It was possible to \"translate\" most of it. And with many months of work, I managed to create a first usable version. Then a year later of constant research and optimizations I finally have this addon! Now considering that I developed my old rendering system closely with ocean, clouds, rainbow (!) and weather system, this addon will grow into a considerable mess. This is why I am developing other components simultaneously to be later combined with atmosphere in a sensible way. Why procedural skies? \u00b6 Industry is still using good old HDRI light probe method to do outdoor lighting, and for a good reason - it is the simplest way to simulate realistic lighting conditions, without worrying that it will look wrong. After all it is a 360\u00b0 snapshot of a real environment. HDRI probes unfortunately are not able to capture one crucial aspect - the fact that sky is dynamic. Sky is not just a membrane of the imaginary rim of the sky, it has volume. Sky is atmosphere and atmosphere is a physical medium consisting of a blend of gases. Sky literally starts just outside of your eyeball and extends to the outer space. Sunlight travels through this medium illuminating, scattering and absorbing in it. procedural skies to the rescue! Procedural skies are more common in games industry, and there the industry have developed way past the static HDRIs, skyboxes or skydomes. Just take a look at the amazing sky system for Horizon Zero Dawn During the years I have been working with, probably, every existing atmosphere system, starting from the good old O'Neil's \"Accurate Atmospheric Scattering\" method, to Preetham model, Eric Bruneton's planet rendering, and Hosek-Wilkie's physical sky model. Each of them have their strengths and, unfortunately, also weaknesses. In fact, none of the existing methods proved versatile enough worth my time making an addon for Blender.

Azimuth moves the Sun horizontally, elevation - vertically. The values are angle in degrees. This is one of many ways you can control Sun position. You can move the Sun also by rotating the Sun object itself or use a Sun Position addon that comes with Blender. These two values are added for convenience if your scene is huge and you have lost the Sun object. Sun Visibility \u00b6 Now the next two parameters might seem confusing for some. Sun Disk checkbox, toggles the visibility of the sun disk in the sky. Sun Lamp checkbox, toggles the sun lamp intensity. I'll explain why these parameters can be useful. There are few specific cases where you don't want to see the Sun disk visible in the sky or don't want your scene illuminated by a parametric lamp. For example, if you use Cycles, you can avoid using a parametric Sun Lamp and use the addon as HDRI. By disabling both, you get illumination by the sky only. No direct light. Sun disk enabled and Sun Lamp disabled , you essentially get a HDRI. Switch to Cycles and you will see how the sun disk is a light source - you get shadows. Sun disk disabled and Sun Lamp enabled , you have shadows and direct light, but the sun disk will not be visible in the sky. (can't think of a useful case for this setting) Both enabled - you have both, direct light and sun disk in the sky. If you compare Cycles renders with Sun Lamp enabled and Sun Lamp disabled, there might not be a visual difference. In Eevee you will see huge difference in lighting and with no parametric light source there will be no shadows. This is because Cycles will sample every point in the sky as a \"light source\", and you will see shadows, while Eevee only approximates the lighting and uses the sky as an \"irradiance map\". Sun Disk \u00b6 Sun disk size in the sky is controlled by Angular Diameter parameter. It also changes the sun lamp Angle value for soft shadows. Larger the value, bigger the sun disk, brighter it gets. Note Right now the Sun disk is a 2D circle with parametric apparent diameter, intensity is multiplied with a limb darkening factor. In future releases Sun will be calculated differently - as a real 3D sphere with actual physical diameter placed reeealy far away, but not at infinity, which will actually allow to travel to the Sun Temperature K changes the color of the sun disk. Bigger the value, bluer the sun. In theory small stars are hotter, thus bluer, and big stars colder - redder. I wanted to include the calculation of that, but it would remove artistic control, so left it as a manual variable. Intensity changes the sun radiance intensity in Watt\u00b7sr/m2. Default value is 20.0 MegaWatt\u00b7sr/m2 (calculated by dividing solar constant with sun disk diameter in steridians) Info In future I might add an option to use Lux values.","title":"Sun"},{"location":"sun/#sun-position","text":"Sun position in the sky is controlled by the first two variables - Azimuth and Elevation . Azimuth moves the Sun horizontally, elevation - vertically. The values are angle in degrees. This is one of many ways you can control Sun position. You can move the Sun also by rotating the Sun object itself or use a Sun Position addon that comes with Blender. These two values are added for convenience if your scene is huge and you have lost the Sun object.","title":"Sun Position"},{"location":"sun/#sun-visibility","text":"Now the next two parameters might seem confusing for some. Sun Disk checkbox, toggles the visibility of the sun disk in the sky. Sun Lamp checkbox, toggles the sun lamp intensity. I'll explain why these parameters can be useful. There are few specific cases where you don't want to see the Sun disk visible in the sky or don't want your scene illuminated by a parametric lamp. For example, if you use Cycles, you can avoid using a parametric Sun Lamp and use the addon as HDRI. By disabling both, you get illumination by the sky only. No direct light. Sun disk enabled and Sun Lamp disabled , you essentially get a HDRI. Switch to Cycles and you will see how the sun disk is a light source - you get shadows. Sun disk disabled and Sun Lamp enabled , you have shadows and direct light, but the sun disk will not be visible in the sky. (can't think of a useful case for this setting) Both enabled - you have both, direct light and sun disk in the sky. If you compare Cycles renders with Sun Lamp enabled and Sun Lamp disabled, there might not be a visual difference. In Eevee you will see huge difference in lighting and with no parametric light source there will be no shadows. This is because Cycles will sample every point in the sky as a \"light source\", and you will see shadows, while Eevee only approximates the lighting and uses the sky as an \"irradiance map\".","title":"Sun Visibility"},{"location":"sun/#sun-disk","text":"Sun disk size in the sky is controlled by Angular Diameter parameter. It also changes the sun lamp Angle value for soft shadows. Larger the value, bigger the sun disk, brighter it gets. Note Right now the Sun disk is a 2D circle with parametric apparent diameter, intensity is multiplied with a limb darkening factor. In future releases Sun will be calculated differently - as a real 3D sphere with actual physical diameter placed reeealy far away, but not at infinity, which will actually allow to travel to the Sun Temperature K changes the color of the sun disk.
